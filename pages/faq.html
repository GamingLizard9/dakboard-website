                                <p>The company that makes DAKboards allows you to load their software onto other devices so people could assemble their own DAKboards.</p>
                                <p>Because this is a long process to set up, I have decided to offer it as a service.</p>
                            </div>
                        </div>

                                <p class="title is-size-4">Why shouldn't I buy from DAKboard?</p>
                                <p>In short: It's significantly more expensive, and you have to do the work yourself.</p>
                                <p>A DAKboard from them costs almost double what I charge for parts and installation ($550 vs. $300).</p>
                                <p>You can buy just the computer board from them, but that costs over $100, and you still need to purchase a monitor!</p>
                                <p>Finally, their microSD card costs $25, which I can reproduce for half that.</p>
                                <p>So, buying from me is cheaper from buying from them, and I do the installation!</p>

                                <p class="title is-size-4">How does making a purchase work?</p>
                                <p>First, reach out to me. Then, I will send you some products to buy on Amazon, which you will have shipped to your house. </p>
                                <p>Then, we arrange a time where I come to you and set it up.</p>
                                <p>Because you bought the parts yourself, you only pay me for labor.</p>

                                <p class="title is-size-4">Is this a touchscreen?</p>
                                <p>No. This display is meant to be controlled from your phone or computer, and it will automatically update from the apps on your device.</p>
                                <p>There is some functionality that can be done from a touchscreen, such as rotate the photo or scroll the calendar. However, I wouldn't reccomend this for a couple of reasons:</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>The amount you can do with a touchscreen is very limited at this time.</li>
                                    <li>Touchscreen monitors are more expensive, so it will add at least $100 to the overall cost.</li>
                                    <li>Touchscreens don't work great with scheduling the board on/off, so if you have it turn off at night, it breaks the touchscreen.</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>Because of this, I wouldn't reccomend getting a touchscreen, but if you do, I can set it up.</p>

                                    <p>The parts on Amazon flucuate in price, but are generaly betwee $150-$200.</p>
                                    <p>How much is charged for labor depends on how long it takes me to set it up.</p>
                                    <p>You can expect to pay $100 for setup if it takes less than 1.5 hours, and $50 for each additional hour.</p>
                                    <p>The $300 figure on the front page is an estimate which is subject to change.</p>

                                <p>The company who makes the software charges a subscription fee for some features in order to cover the costs of servers to keep the software running.</p>
                                <p>If I had control over this, there would not be a subscription, but it is what it is.</p>
                                <p>Do not let this dissuade you from making a purchase; most features can still be accessed without one.</p>

                                <p>If you pay their subscription, the main feature is <strong>custom layouts</strong>.</p>
                                <p>These allow you to choose exactly what appears on your screen, and exactly where it is.</p>
                                <p>You can do some customizing on the free plan, but paying for a subscription is a lot less limiting.</p>
                                <p>It also allows you to load 5 calendars instead of 2, and access to additional integrations.</p>

                                <p>If you would like to buy a different monitor, make sure it is IPS. Otherwise, it will not look good at an angle!</p>
                                <p>If you are buying a more expensive monitor, look into a 1440p or 4k monitor, or maybe one of a larger size!</p>
                                <p>However, buying a more powerful Raspberry Pi computer board will make little to no difference. I would not reccomend buying a cheaper one.</p>
